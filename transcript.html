                <h4>Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised</h4>
                <p>
                  "Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised" is
                  inspired by the work of Christy Nolan, the extraordinary Irish
                  author and poet who overcame his challenges of cerebral palsy
                  to create impactful Irish literature. His dedication to his
                  artistic voice and the power of his words stand as a testament
                  to the human drive to communicate and create. Growing up with
                  dyslexia meant that I often struggled with finding the beauty
                  and enjoyment of the written word. Instead, I discovered a
                  relationship with music, learning through listening and
                  feeling. Music became a language that spoke to me with a
                  clarity, a world where my understanding flourished through
                  sound and emotion. This piece, "Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were
                  About to Be Realised," in its energetic bursts and fluid
                  shifts, reflects a journey of discovery of expression. The
                  "zealous" quality speaks to the passionate drive to create and
                  express, while the "mercurial" nature embodies the freedom and
                  fluidity I found in connecting with music on my own terms.
                  Ultimately, this piece is an expression of the joy and
                  liberation found in the expression of language. It's offered
                  as a tribute to the spirit of Christy Nolan and a reflection
                  of my own unique path towards the joy of language.

                  I have written a personal essay about how I got through an
                  especially sunny day as an albino. On many occasions, the
                  sunlight is manageable but on many, it isn't. That's what
                  happened during a bookshop-run and I've tried to capture how I
                  made it to my destination without bumping into a fellow human
                  or a pole. It also captures how I am comfortable and proud
                  telling everyone about my condition, which didn't happen
                  overnight, but I am glad that it has eventually.

                <h4>Avantika Singhal ~ Peronal Essay</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> This submission presents a
                  personal essay titled “Personal Essay Submission” by Avantika
                  Singhal, reflecting on lived experiences of albinism,
                  identity, and navigating everyday encounters in Dublin.
                  Written in a lyrical, introspective tone, the piece captures a
                  moment of personal vulnerability and empowerment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Now could he ever get his chance to let folk see what they
                  thought never existed?" (Christopher Nolan - Under the Eye of
                  the Clock p.53)
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's panic. There's hesitation. And, there's one recurring
                  thought - you all are just silhouettes to me: black, mobile,
                  and unpredictable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I let this thought consume me as I stand in the sharp Irish
                  sunlight on a street somewhere in St. Stephen's Green,
                  shielding my eyes despite wearing sunglasses. Can I see
                  anything clearly? No. You all are a blur and by “you” I mean
                  all the Dubliners spreading in all directions, going about
                  their day - oblivious to a middle-aged albino girl who can't
                  seem to see straight despite eye protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This happens more than you'd expect. Usually, when I am alone,
                  I walk it off, praying that the sunbeams become kinder in time
                  and that I can make my way to my destination without being run
                  over or pushed down on the buzzing pavements. However, when I
                  am walking with someone, say a friend or family member and the
                  Sun is reaching unprecedented heights, my pace slows, my steps

                  Today, the Sun is a little less forgiving even though I am
                  alone. By some miracle and a sprinkle of perseverance, I push
                  through the shapes and successfully make my way to Books
                  Upstairs, an unmistakably blue bookshop labelled as “Ireland's
                  oldest”. The need to be surrounded by books is all-consuming
                  at this juncture of time and space and it also gives me a
                  chance to hide from the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I enter gracelessly and my demeanour changes instantly. The
                  colours, the titles, the bookworms - oh so tempting! But am I
                  here to splurge on a trending hardcover? No. The reason why I
                  am here is because I am somewhat of a Hot Chocolate
                  connoisseur and I must test all the milky-chocolatey
                  concoctions I can get my glove-clad hands on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I make my way upstairs (no book in hand, mind you) and
                  awkwardly order my forever-favourite beverage. The barista is
                  a 20-something college-going girl who couldn't stop yapping
                  about the latest Hunger Games book before I ordered. That was
                  until she wasn't riveted by my accent - which is an
                  inauthentic and not-so-compelling mixture of Indian and
                  American. However, she is invested now, and asks me without
                  preamble, “Where are you from?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here we go again. Time to explain how someone with ginger hair
                  (I dye it), violet, nystagmus-riddled eyes, and a pale
                  complexion sounds like an Indian. Where is she from?!, her
                  brain must be toiling to trace my roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I tend to cherish and detest such interactions. There have
                  been so many ever since I came to Dublin that I can almost
                  predict how the person is going to react to my origin story.
                  Once I solve the mystery for them, I do feel liberated; like I
                  have just reinstated to myself that I am comfortable in my
                  skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I offer her a brief explanation gently, “India, but I am
                  albino.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's no surprise when she raises her eyebrows and opens her
                  mouth in an 'o' shape. Yes, yes, cue the surprise. She has
                  finally spotted an Indian-looking Irish young woman in the
                  modern-day wilderness. Huzza!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within seconds, the shocked 'o' turns into an understanding
                  'o' and she hands me my drink with a tiny smile on her face.
                  She's absorbing the information and trying to be polite at the
                  same time. I get it. I always do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I should have never existed. Yet I do. I am the best kind of
                  anomaly. One that knocks you off your feet and forces you to
                  reconsider what you think you know about biology, considering
                  both my parents wear brown skins back home with pride and
                  love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Albinism is a hindrance sometimes. Crossing the road, reading
                  tiny fonts, spotting someone from afar…But it's also a gift
                  and the biggest gift I can give myself is the gift of
                  self-acceptance.s

                  I may not have superpowers but I still possess the ability to
                  stupefy people with my looks and my genealogy. For me, it
                  doesn't get better than that.

                  How did the Christy Nolan quote you chose to use influence the

                </h4>
                <p>
                  I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words
                  echo with truth,' because it captures the tension between
                  feeling unheard and knowing our experiences still carry
                  weight. As someone who uses alternative communication methods,
                  I've often felt that my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I
                  believe that even the quiet or unconventional ways we express
                  ourselves can resonate powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave
                  me the confidence to highlight this quiet strength in my
                  piece—conveying how, despite the seeming 'silence,' our truths
                  can create ripples of understanding and empathy in others.

                  I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the
                  Christy Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of
                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with
                  different mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital
                  tools—until I found the combination that best conveyed the
                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.
                  Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these
                  methods, the 2 experience ultimately helped me create a more

                  I hope that my piece reminds people that perseverance is not
                  just about pushing through difficult circumstances—it's also
                  about embracing your own story and identity in the process. By
                  weaving together visuals and narration that reflect personal
                  growth, I wanted to show how creative expression can transform
                  our struggles into something powerful and unifying.

                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with

                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.

                  I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words

                  feeling unheard and knowing our experiences still carry

                  I've often felt that my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I
                  believe that even the quiet or unconventional ways we express
                  ourselves can resonate powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave
                  me the confidence to highlight this quiet strength in my
                  piece—conveying how, despite the seeming 'silence,' our truths

                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with
                  different mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital
                  tools—until I found the combination that best conveyed the
                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and

                <p>
                  I submitted an original oil painting of mine. This piece
                  relates to the quotation 'Zealous mercurial dreams were about
                  to be realized.'. This piece represents the excitement and
                  unpredictability of dreams about to be realised. The red
                  underpainting was chosen to symbolise the passion and
                  intensity of the dreams. It creates a warm but theatrical
                  composition. The bending road represents the unpredictable and
                  changing nature of the dreams, why is the road bending and
                  where does it lead to? The smaller three paths present in the
                  composition represent the notion of choice, which path will be
                  chosen and where will it take you. This reinforces the notion
                  of change. The backward sign symbolises the unconventional
                  route to success. The sign which is supposed to provide
                  direction is facing the wrong way, this suggests that
                  following traditional paths might not lead you to the
                  realisation of your dreams. The sign signifies the idea that
                  sometimes in order for your big dreams to come true you must
                  follow your own intuition and ignore external expectations.
                  The painting also captures a certain volatility that is most
                  prominent in the sky itself. The tension is signified by the
                  stormy sky and dark clouds. The moment of realisation is
                  captured by the state of the sky. Initially we see a
                  tumultuous sky however when you look closer you notice the two
                  white spots either side of the piece. The white spots signify
                  a hopefulness, a shift in mood and a change that is about to
                  occur. The storm is passing, the clouds are clearing and the
                  dreams are about to be realised.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  I hope that my piece reminds people that perseverance is not
                  just about pushing through difficult circumstances—it's also
                  about embracing your own story and identity in the process. By
                  weaving together visuals and narration that reflect personal
                  growth, I wanted to show how creative expression can transform
                  our struggles into something powerful and unifying.
                  Ultimately, my aim is for anyone experiencing the work to feel
                  seen and encouraged to use their own voice, recognizing that
                  every unique perspective adds depth and beauty to our shared
                  human experience.
                </p>
