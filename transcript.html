                <h4>What is this series?</h4>
                <p>
                  This series is about my personal experience being
                  neurodivergent in the modern world. Being late diagnosed, it
                  can be difficult to express my true thoughts without the
                  feeling of scrutiny creeping in. This is why I'm very proud to
                  be part of an exhibition that uplifts artists in the same
                  position as me and strives to spread the positive message of
                  unity.
                </p>
                <h4>What is art to me?</h4>
                <p>
                  As you may be able to recognize from the poems in this series,
                  art is to me what it is for most - an outlet for your soul.
                  However, I believe it can be used to promote positive change
                  and feelings, and this angle, to me, is when art is at its
                  finest.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  What role does art play in building an inclusive future?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  As previously mentioned, art's promotion of positive change is
                  crucial in building something beautiful. Perhaps one day the
                  right words, or lyrics, or any sculpture of feeling can tug
                  the heartstrings of those who never knew they had any to begin
                  with.
                </p>

                  blocks describing a neurodivergent artist's experience, their
                  view on art, and its role in building an inclusive future.
                  Below, there's a photo of a water lily pond with large green
                  leaves, a red flower in the foreground, and a plant label
                  reading "Victoria cruziana." The design highlights unity,
                  personal expression, and the impact of art on positive change.

                  "Shimmer" by C. Keller on a cream background with red borders
                  at the top. The poem reflects on the passage of time,
                  self-reflection, and the search for meaning. Below the poem, a
                  vibrant photograph showcases a serene lake surrounded by a
                  forest of autumn-colored trees with their reflections mirrored
                  in the water. A small house with red and white accents sits
                  peacefully by the lakeside under a bright blue sky.

                  And all day that were and when,<br />
                  I never took it, all, within the clock<br />
                  Hung and dragged by the minute's hand,<br />
                  Too slow to reveal life itself,<br />
                  The blood streaks lead to full circle.<br />
                  In never ending thought of something new.<br />
                  And off in search of higher waters,<br />
                  They brave the sea once more for cod.<br />
                  But conned by the loch's promise of forever,<br />
                  They're drowned by their own conscience,<br />
                  Living in time, in essence, but,<br />
                  In never ending thought of something new.<br />

                  Escape is often defined as a freedom of the will<br />
                  An essential in your finest hours<br />
                  My brain however works different to 'ours'<br />
                  I eat the Earth and chew the pill.<br />
                  When I cry I have to write<br />
                  I know I'll never reach the scenes of the screen<br />
                  The field, the forest, calling me<br />
                  To end the noise that plagues the plight.<br />
                  But could I take the noise's end?<br />
                  Nature tells me whispers I know<br />
                  All too well. The dove or the crow?<br />
                  Or the gruesome cliff, and edge.<br />
                  But as I lay in heaven's bed I feel the breeze<br />
                  Warmed by the blue and the flowers I owe<br />
                  The feeling of peace as my leaf is blown<br />
                  As my words and I float among the trees.<br />

                  contemplative nature of a windmill, exploring themes of
                  stillness, science, and the significance of silence. Below the
                  poem, a black-and-white photograph showcases two traditional
                  windmills by the water, with rippling waves in the foreground
                  and soft clouds in the sky, creating a serene and nostalgic
                  atmosphere.

                  And crane enough to up to thrill<br />
                  But today it's not fortune that keeps pace<br />
                  I must admit when thought is killed<br />
                  I yearn to know the cold embrace<br />

                <h4>Very brief description of the work:</h4>
                <p>
                  My piece, "In the Silence, We Hear," is a visual and poetic
                  reflection on hearing loss. It features a poem paired with the
                  word "inclusion" in sign language. The piece expresses the
                  quiet strength of those, including myself, who navigate a
                  world without full hearing.
                </p>
                <h4>What does art mean to you?</h4>
                <p>
                  To me, art is a voice beyond words. It is a way to express
                  emotions, experiences, and perspectives that cannot always be
                  easily shared. Art connects us, even when we face barriers.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  In your opinion, what role does art play in building an
                  inclusive future?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Writing allows us to share personal stories that might
                  otherwise go unheard. By giving voice to our struggles and
                  perspectives, written or visual art becomes a bridge to
                  understanding. It's a therapeutic and healing process that
                  opens doors for empathy, helping others connect with different
                  experiences. In this way, art plays a crucial role in building
                  a more inclusive and compassionate future.

                  ALT Description: An illustration titled "In the Silence, We
                  Hear" featuring hand signs forming letters of the alphabet in
                  Irish Sign Language (ISL), with hands of diverse skin tones.
                  Below the illustration, a poem explores themes of living in
                  silence, navigating a quiet world, and embracing differences.
                  It emphasizes that silence is not emptiness but full of
                  unspoken meaning, calling for understanding and breaking
                  through barriers together. The design combines accessibility
                  awareness with inclusivity and empowerment.

                <p>
                  This is for my mum. “Worrying is worshiping the problem” is
                  something my mum has started saying to me recently and it
                  stuck with me. The two graphics represent the spiral an
                  anxiety attack can cause. The grid and abstract spacing
                  represents the struggle to be grounded and remember that it is
                  only worshipping the problem.

                  creating a cat's cradle string figure. Below it, text reads:
                  "Worrying is worshiping the problem." Additional squares
                  include an illustration of a person standing next to a
                  spherical diagram labeled "Horizon" and "Now." The bottom-left
                  square states, "Redirect the energy toward solutions, hope,
                  and trust in the process." The design emphasizes reflection,
                  mindfulness, and focusing energy positively.

                <p>
                  This is a piece representing a form of OCD that I have lived
                  with for most of my life. Constant 'what if?' scenarios would
                  come into my mind, paired with compulsions. And then I saw
                  this quote of “What if it all works out?” Which flipped the
                  narrative.

                  bold, distressed text "WHAT IF?" at the top in a fragmented,
                  edgy font. Below, vertical and diagonal phrases in varying
                  alignments repeat anxious thoughts such as "Check it," "Count
                  to five," "Don't step on the crack," and "Rewrite it." At the
                  bottom, subtle embossed text reads, "What if it all works
                  out?" The design captures a contrast between worry and hope,
                  exploring themes of overthinking and optimism.

                <h4>Explanation of Poems Jessica K. Doyle</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Trains</strong> was written after my first day of
                  college, during a moment of reflection as I waited for the
                  train. While I stood in stillness, observing, others buzzed
                  with anticipation, and the poem captures this contrast—a quiet
                  contemplation of transition and movement and diverse
                  perceptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pink Lanes:</strong> emerged instinctively, without a
                  planned structure, as much of my writing does. It speaks to
                  the experience of processing something lost yet lingering in
                  the mind—a journey of processing attempts and plans for more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Fizzy Feet</strong> explores the beauty of slowing
                  down and taking scenic routes literally and metaphorically.
                  Written in a moment of magic and music and connection, Though
                  not initially about cats, On reflection it reminded me of
                  moments spent walking with my two cats, where their curiosity
                  anchors me to the present. Their playful exploration reminds
                  me of childhood nostalgia—muddy boots stuck in the
                  muck,—little paws and how nature teaches us to slow down and
                  immerse ourselves, even in moments of discomfort. The poem is
                  also about finding growth and reflection in those too-light or
                  too-tight or uncomfortable spaces and the wonder and growth
                  one can find in the places we often try to avoid.

                <p>
                  <strong>Art</strong>, to me, is a bridge between my inner
                  world and the external reality—a language that mirrors the way
                  my thoughts naturally form. It offers a structure that feels
                  more aligned with how I process and understand the world,
                  allowing me to translate emotions, ideas, and experiences into
                  something tangible. Through art, I can express complexities
                  that often feel impossible to convey with words, giving shape
                  to what resides within and creating a space where others can
                  glimpse and connect with my internal landscape

                <p>
                  ALT Description: A poem titled Fizzy Feet by Jessica K. Doyle
                  is written in black text on a soft gradient background of
                  green and yellow hues. The poem describes themes of
                  reflection, nostalgia, and finding peace. In the bottom-right
                  corner, there is a simple black outline drawing of a cat
                  stepping into a puddle, its tail raised. The illustration adds
                  a whimsical touch to the contemplative tone of the poem.

                  Wait for me when racing forth<br />
                  To planes of rushes<br />
                  And paths of dust<br />
                  Where weightless feathers<br />
                  Feel heavy in the wind<br />
                  Wait a minute don't rush to the end<br />
                  Stop and fall and crash into a ball<br />
                  Fractured and beaten, awake to it all<br />
                  Feel the fizz and whine and pop<br />
                  Of long lost lands of laughter that's rough<br />
                  Slow your pace to observe the race<br />
                  And find yourself get lost in a stream of grace<br />
                  Wash up in whirl winds<br />
                  Let sounds pulse through your soul<br />
                  Sorrowful and sweet<br />
                  Fizzy in my feet<br />
                  Breaks through the dams<br />
                  To these less walked far distant lands<br />
                  Or maybe there always here<br />
                  In the everyday<br />
                  Waiting for the wanderers<br />
                  To stop awhile and play<br />
                  Even just a glance through a crack on the door<br />
                  There always here lying on the floor.<br />
                  Whisper to me<br />
                  on gently rocking waters<br />
                  Call me home<br />
                  With tendrils of nostalgia<br />
                  Piece by piece<br />
                  We'll find our feet<br />
                  In pieces we'll weep<br />
                  Till we wash away<br />
                  what make us screech<br />
                  In pain, laid down in a heap<br />
                  We will keep each of us close<br />
                  in reach<br />
                  Pitch forward your ideas and don't feel like you have to

                  Be strong in your roots<br />
                  In water tight boots<br />
                  Cut through rubber<br />

                  and that my friend is all it took.

                  ALT Description: A poem titled Pink Lanes by Jessica K. Doyle
                  is displayed on a white background with splashes of pink and
                  black ink framing the page. The poem explores themes of pain,
                  memory, and the struggle for clarity. At the bottom right,
                  there is a circular abstract illustration in shades of pink,
                  purple, and teal, resembling a microscopic or cosmic view. The
                  artwork complements the reflective and introspective tone of
                  the poem.

                <p>
                  Pink lanes of pain making tracks through my brain.<br />
                  Snaking in winding pain.<br />
                  Burrow down till some days I don't recall<br />
                  that fraught seeming so tall times that don't ever thaw.<br />
                  Pink freezing rain smashes<br />
                  down in the voices that stick,<br />
                  thick tastes of liquorice.<br />
                  I'll drown it out when roads roar to life<br />
                  with nowhere to run and no way to fight.<br />
                  I know I need to go there to take away its life.<br />
                  I don't want to welcome anyone in, whether friend or foe<br />
                  I know I'm going to barricade the door.<br />
                  Disgust seeps in through my pores making puddles of yuck along
                  the floor.<br />
                  I've slipped in them many times before.<br />
                  And felt the sludge cling to my skin, sour breath smothers and
                  sometimes stings.<br />
                  That memory is a mess of jagged pieces, scratching in ways
                  that make colours go blind <br />
                  and white walls take too much space as if in spite.<br />
                  I can't remember.<br />
                  And I can't remember if what I remember fits or<br />
                  falls to crash to glass fragments, Smash, Bad Luck.<br />
                  I don't want to have another look.<br />
                  I've swept those floors all the way out but<br />
                  they catch in the gusts of storms and always find their way
                  back to settle again, under<br />
                  furniture absorbing the softness, the colour, the hues.<br />
                  Eating away at the shadows,<br />
                  till again I'm here in this bright white walled room with pink
                  leaving traces of ultraviolet ink.<br />
                  Won't ever wash away.<br />
                  Where is this space that leaves such a harsh trace, <br />
                  I'll need to travel it all to find where it sticks.<br />
                  I like to think it clings somehow, easy to fling.<br />
                  I'll pick up that whole board and throw it out, <br />
                  but to where every place has too much glare<br />
                  it'll find a new way to the Fallen king caught by a queen,<br />
                  and we will begin this game again.<br />
                  I need to find another way.<br />

                <p>
                  ALT Description: A poem titled Trains by Jessica K. Doyle is
                  presented on a soft beige background with faint train track
                  illustrations running vertically along both sides. The poem
                  delves into themes of anticipation, movement, and
                  introspection, exploring metaphors of trains and their
                  journeys. The imagery evokes both physical and emotional
                  travels, capturing fleeting moments of reflection and
                  connection. At the bottom, a train track loops, symbolizing
                  the continuous journey. The text is laid out in a clear,
                  elegant format, complemented by the train motif.

                  <i>By Jessica K. Doyle</i><br />
                  Waiting once, it was hard but not today, <br />
                  the jittering sense of anticipation blocked out by the giddy
                  yet delicate confidence.<br />
                  Heads sway from side to side<br />
                  Stand up, arch necks, look up<br />
                  On the board it stares back<br />
                  20 minutes late.<br />
                  Back and forth the tension filling up the space,<br />
                  Detached from it today.<br />
                  The pigeons fly<br />
                  A motor rolls on in the window sill, I wonder what love's in
                  there.<br />
                  Grated windows would they open to adventures creatures had
                  among the tracks.<br />
                  Weeds and polls spike up from roofs.<br />
                  People start to pace<br />
                  An announcer explains further<br />
                  Phones come out heads sway in the liminal dance of uncertainty
                  steeped in anticipation.<br />
                  There all running ahead in this race.<br />
                  Human clocks, fueled on feelings of time, but never of the
                  present you'd never need a watch in this place.<br />
                  What would it be if we took moments in the stress in the
                  liminal to just sit and observe<br />
                  Build around the person<br />
                  maybe would get us there<br />
                  Build back up curiosity and wonder.<br />
                  Is that possible from the outside to reach in or does the
                  inside need help to reach out.<br />
                  A cold breeze flows.<br />
                  I notice the discomfort<br />
                  maybe it's another challenge not to fall into it but sit with
                  it.<br />
                  I had happiness today though<br />
                  Success fulfillment achievements and confidence<br />
                  those factors need to be taken into account<br />
                  The sun shines down again and suddenly the air is warm the
                  coolness is still there but resembles the contrary of hot tea
                  with ice cream.<br />
                  I could be at the beach looking out to the vast waves wrapped
                  in a warm blanket hair blowing in coastal breeze.<br />
                  It's strong in resemblance even while I sit waiting or pausing
                  in this moment to take it in and the train is here.<br />
                  In we go to the next moment.<br />
                  The rush begins again to get a seat.<br />
                  Or maybe not, the doors stay locked<br />
                  The clouds move in whispers to the right and suddenly it's
                  like I'm on a boat, a yellow streaked concrete boat.<br />
                  Let's sit back down change this delusion of time.<br />
                  Perception is time to hallucinate.<br />
                  And off it moves across the tracks<br />
                  In swarms people fall back retreat downtrodden and unsure.<br />
                  Some give up and stamp off the platform. Too much force
                  applied to each footstep.<br />
                  The bricks, they lie quite normal in upward vertical
                  horizontal jumps but today like slithering snakes upon their
                  way, never ending.<br />
                  Fitting for the station.<br />
                  Only for a moment and back to bricks.<br />
                  Now I've figured out how to make it flip.<br />
                  The beats pick up<br />
                  I've an urge to stand up and move and dance<br />
                  Exuberant and circling but maybe that might be too much.<br />
                  Out by the trees closer to home I'll be free to spin and sing
                  till darkness gently pulls me in.<br />
                  And safety yellow lines might collide into water slides if
                  dancing was afoot.<br />
                  And that would require the lending of a new book and we'll
                  alas I'm finally enjoying this one.<br />
                  And two now arrive at once<br />
                  And a race of trains ensues,<br />
                  Which one will get the flocks there faster.<br />
                  Unseuredness rises like lime buzzing bees protecting some
                  invisible queen.<br />
                  Most race to the first but stare in disbelief in their two
                  fast choices as the familiar one arrives on the right side.<br />
                  That grabbing feeling for what is known but panic at an idea
                  of missing both if change is attempted, whips across many a
                  face.<br />
                  I'll go with comfort and the view of the roof tops.<br />
                  If I could navigate life across the roof tops and bypass the
                  streets I would.<br />
                  Even with the risk of a sudden plunge and the possibly of a
                  factory line system of borrowing books.<br />
                  I would,<br />
                  Wonder lives on roof tops. Bounds and bounds of it.<br />
                  But there would be no guarantee the next story would even have
                  roof tops.<br />
                  Or silky black four legged fluffs.<br />
                  We'd miss<br />
                  So I'll take the hustle, the bustle the bangs and shouts and
                  stimulus pouring in floods and crashing in waterfalls, on
                  ankles with mechanical faults.<br />
                  Be sure, well… they are my family of fluffs.<br />
                  I'll go now, breathe in each moment. Feel the hum and the purr
                  and rock of the waves of tracks below.<br />
                  A warm glow waits for me to catch it and see where we will go.

                <h4>Audrey Steinier</h4>
                <p>
                  This artwork is about the frustration and pain that comes with
                  having a disability or illness that is not understood by the
                  medical community. I have been prescribed medication for my
                  chronic pain where the side effects of that medication were
                  more pain of the same variety. Doctors are unsure of the
                  origin of your pain or how you experience the pain, and so
                  seem to prescribe medication based on your explanation of the
                  pain (being neurodivergent does not help with this). In this
                  artwork I have used my own medication tablets, their side
                  effects, and the 2025 national gallery of Ireland's calendar.

                  Audrey Steinier - What does art mean to you? What role does

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Art is one of the only ways for marginalised people to express
                  themselves in a capitalist society. Through art, marginalised
                  people can make themselves and their opinions visible to the
                  dominant culture. Hopefully pushing for change not just in the
                  art space but in greater society. Through art an individual
                  can also process their anger and sadness that occurs in our
                  current system of governance.
