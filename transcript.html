                <h4>Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised</h4>
                <p>
                  "Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised" is
                  inspired by the work of Christy Nolan, the extraordinary Irish
                  author and poet who overcame his challenges of cerebral palsy
                  to create impactful Irish literature. His dedication to his
                  artistic voice and the power of his words stand as a testament
                  to the human drive to communicate and create. Growing up with
                  dyslexia meant that I often struggled with finding the beauty
                  and enjoyment of the written word. Instead, I discovered a
                  relationship with music, learning through listening and
                  feeling. Music became a language that spoke to me with a
                  clarity, a world where my understanding flourished through
                  sound and emotion. This piece, "Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were
                  About to Be Realised," in its energetic bursts and fluid
                  shifts, reflects a journey of discovery of expression. The
                  "zealous" quality speaks to the passionate drive to create and
                  express, while the "mercurial" nature embodies the freedom and
                  fluidity I found in connecting with music on my own terms.
                  Ultimately, this piece is an expression of the joy and
                  liberation found in the expression of language. It's offered
                  as a tribute to the spirit of Christy Nolan and a reflection
                  of my own unique path towards the joy of language.

                <p>
                  I have written a personal essay about how I got through an
                  especially sunny day as an albino. On many occasions, the
                  sunlight is manageable but on many, it isn't. That's what
                  happened during a bookshop-run and I've tried to capture how I
                  made it to my destination without bumping into a fellow human
                  or a pole. It also captures how I am comfortable and proud
                  telling everyone about my condition, which didn't happen
                  overnight, but I am glad that it has eventually.

                <h4>Avantika Singhal ~ Peronal Essay</h4>
                <p>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> This submission presents a
                  personal essay titled “Personal Essay Submission” by Avantika
                  Singhal, reflecting on lived experiences of albinism,
                  identity, and navigating everyday encounters in Dublin.
                  Written in a lyrical, introspective tone, the piece captures a
                  moment of personal vulnerability and empowerment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Now could he ever get his chance to let folk see what they
                  thought never existed?" (Christopher Nolan - Under the Eye of
                  the Clock p.53)
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's panic. There's hesitation. And, there's one recurring
                  thought - you all are just silhouettes to me: black, mobile,
                  and unpredictable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I let this thought consume me as I stand in the sharp Irish
                  sunlight on a street somewhere in St. Stephen's Green,
                  shielding my eyes despite wearing sunglasses. Can I see
                  anything clearly? No. You all are a blur and by “you” I mean
                  all the Dubliners spreading in all directions, going about
                  their day - oblivious to a middle-aged albino girl who can't
                  seem to see straight despite eye protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This happens more than you'd expect. Usually, when I am alone,
                  I walk it off, praying that the sunbeams become kinder in time
                  and that I can make my way to my destination without being run
                  over or pushed down on the buzzing pavements. However, when I
                  am walking with someone, say a friend or family member and the
                  Sun is reaching unprecedented heights, my pace slows, my steps
                  falter and the eye-shielding is ten times more vigorous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, the Sun is a little less forgiving even though I am
                  alone. By some miracle and a sprinkle of perseverance, I push
                  through the shapes and successfully make my way to Books
                  Upstairs, an unmistakably blue bookshop labelled as “Ireland's
                  oldest”. The need to be surrounded by books is all-consuming
                  at this juncture of time and space and it also gives me a
                  chance to hide from the Sun.

                <p>
                  I enter gracelessly and my demeanour changes instantly. The
                  colours, the titles, the bookworms - oh so tempting! But am I
                  here to splurge on a trending hardcover? No. The reason why I
                  am here is because I am somewhat of a Hot Chocolate
                  connoisseur and I must test all the milky-chocolatey
                  concoctions I can get my glove-clad hands on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I make my way upstairs (no book in hand, mind you) and
                  awkwardly order my forever-favourite beverage. The barista is
                  a 20-something college-going girl who couldn't stop yapping
                  about the latest Hunger Games book before I ordered. That was
                  until she wasn't riveted by my accent - which is an
                  inauthentic and not-so-compelling mixture of Indian and
                  American. However, she is invested now, and asks me without
                  preamble, “Where are you from?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here we go again. Time to explain how someone with ginger hair
                  (I dye it), violet, nystagmus-riddled eyes, and a pale
                  complexion sounds like an Indian. Where is she from?!, her
                  brain must be toiling to trace my roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I tend to cherish and detest such interactions. There have
                  been so many ever since I came to Dublin that I can almost
                  predict how the person is going to react to my origin story.
                  Once I solve the mystery for them, I do feel liberated; like I
                  have just reinstated to myself that I am comfortable in my
                  skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I offer her a brief explanation gently, “India, but I am
                  albino.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's no surprise when she raises her eyebrows and opens her
                  mouth in an 'o' shape. Yes, yes, cue the surprise. She has
                  finally spotted an Indian-looking Irish young woman in the
                  modern-day wilderness. Huzza!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within seconds, the shocked 'o' turns into an understanding
                  'o' and she hands me my drink with a tiny smile on her face.
                  She's absorbing the information and trying to be polite at the
                  same time. I get it. I always do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I should have never existed. Yet I do. I am the best kind of
                  anomaly. One that knocks you off your feet and forces you to
                  reconsider what you think you know about biology, considering
                  both my parents wear brown skins back home with pride and
                  love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Albinism is a hindrance sometimes. Crossing the road, reading
                  tiny fonts, spotting someone from afar…But it's also a gift
                  and the biggest gift I can give myself is the gift of
                  self-acceptance.s

                  I may not have superpowers but I still possess the ability to
                  stupefy people with my looks and my genealogy. For me, it
                  doesn't get better than that.

                <p>
                  The poem is about being someone's confidant but it can be
                  interpreted in many ways. One interpretation is the secret
                  being something malicious but being unable to say it, another
                  is that the temptation to share a secret is a curse in itself.
                  Regardless, the character is no fool.

                  I'd ne'er thrust your trust into ash<br />
                  Nor feed it to our peers<br />
                  To be shared among vultures<br />
                  Gnawing corpses<br />
                  To be spread like a plague<br />
                  Grating sores For truth is a virtue seldom known<br />
                  And your secret a thing for you and I alone<br />
                  I hope you know I hate you<br />
                  And the penance you give so readily<br />
                  Each day I seam my lips tight<br />
                  But I feel it tempt me so<br />
                  To speak your truth<br />
                  Both kind and foul<br />
                  But a confidant is a curse well known<br />
                  So, I'll keep my slit tongue carefully sewn<br />

                  Upon hearing about the competition and learning about
                  Christopher Nolan, I chose to read Under the Eye of the Clock
                  in its entirety to get a better sense of who we are honoring.
                  My piece is a 40-line poem, inspired not only by the quotes
                  provided but by Nolan's memoir and his story as a whole. As
                  someone with an invisible disability I can never know what it
                  is like to have a visible disability, but I can know and
                  understand the inner pain, fight, and isolation that comes
                  with a disability in itself - and I can only hope that I did
                  well in honoring Nolan and his legacy through my poem.

                  Spindly limbs crawl forward<br />
                  pushing, pushing, pulse.<br />
                  Brittle bones and backward ways<br />

                  reach forward, slink back<br />

                  rusting, restlessly, ruthlessly<br />

                  When I was 7, I learned the sun would explode one day. It hit
                  me really hard, as if my dad had said we would all die
                  tomorrow. He laughed, “5 billion years from now. We'll both be
                  dead.” That's true. I hadn't thought of that. And at the time,
                  I remembered evolution and dinosaurs. I had learned more in a
                  few years than I ever would again. And two of the things I
                  learned were that dinosaurs lived here 200 million years ago
                  and that they were awesome. 200 million was not even close to
                  5 billion. I'd been around for 7. That day was one of
                  revelation. My family and I were not the universe, just one of
                  many. I couldn't believe that it was possible nothing from me
                  would definitively exist at an exact, inescapable moment.
                  Sometimes I feel that way about relationships. Sometimes I
                  feel that way with you. That we exist in some seconds of
                  childlike confusion after hearing an inconceivable truth; that
                  a day will come when no trace of us can be found in the other.
                  As I stare into my lovers' eyes each, "There will come a day
                  that I forget you."

                  This piece is a reflection on a journey with depression,
                  spanning over several years. It explores the emergence from a
                  place of darkness, a place where the future felt unreachable,
                  where it becomes difficult to recognise yourself, and
                  existence itself becomes a quiet battle. It aims to articulate
                  the almost imperceptible return to life, the long-awaited
                  escape from mere survival. It was inspired by Christy Nolan's
                  ability to write with such emotional clarity and resilience, I
                  wanted to honour the achievement of surviving, and to
                  acknowledge the beauty but also the fear of moving beyond into
                  a life that you almost forgot existed - where mercurial
                  dreams, once too impossible to contemplate, begin to form. 'to
                  tomorrow, and tomorrow' is a letter to a former self and
                  perhaps a future self, with a promise that life can, and will
                  be, more. I hope it speaks to the experience of living with a
                  hidden disability but also celebrates the power of creativity
                  and self-expression to propel us forward when words and life
                  itself feel too far away to reach, something that has
                  undoubtedly helped me over the years.

                <p>
                  here<br />
                  a breath caught in my throat<br />
                  taken aback<br />
                  by it all<br />
                  23 was an impossibility<br />
                  no future<br />
                  nor light<br />
                  shrouded by a constant darkness<br />
                  penetrated only by the weight<br />
                  of living<br />
                  at war<br />
                  an attack from within<br />
                  clawed hands ripping at my mind<br />
                  its jagged edges<br />
                  cutting through the soft flesh<br />
                  of my chest<br />
                  spilling<br />
                  losing hope<br />
                  leaking<br />
                  slowly<br />
                  slowly<br />
                  slowly<br />
                  drawing out brilliance<br />
                  leaving a<br />
                  sparkless<br />
                  dull<br />
                  shell<br />
                  how long does it take for scars to heal<br />
                  i cannot give you an exact<br />
                  timeline<br />
                  i wish i could tell you<br />
                  by day 912<br />
                  that<br />
                  wounds will begin to repair<br />
                  muscles will knit together<br />
                  skin will reach across and embrace<br />
                  connected once again<br />
                  the drip will slow<br />
                  and inevitably stop<br />
                  i cannot tell you this<br />
                  but<br />
                  there will be a day<br />
                  when you will realise<br />
                  that there are emotions on the fringes<br />
                  at the edge of the abyss<br />
                  tentatively creeping<br />
                  toward your mind<br />
                  your heart<br />
                  they will slowly pry open<br />
                  doors you thought<br />
                  were long bolted shut<br />
                  and the darkness<br />
                  will not be so black<br />
                  it will slowly transform<br />
                  bursting with purples<br />
                  blue and green<br />
                  hues that have been forgotten<br />
                  breaking across your mind's eye<br />
                  as beautiful as a dawn<br />
                  a world will open before you<br />
                  misshapen and blunt<br />
                  and it will be yours<br />
                  all yours<br />
                  there will be music to feel<br />
                  views to drink in<br />
                  stories to tell<br />
                  and questions to ask<br />
                  laughs that will give you pains, such pleasant pains<br />
                  tears that will feel like a blessing<br />
                  love to offer<br />
                  and love to accept<br />
                  albeit a hesitating hand<br />
                  but you are so deserving of it<br />
                  so deserving<br />
                  you always have been<br />
                  always<br />
                  your days will extend<br />
                  you will finally see beyond the night<br />
                  to tomorrow and tomorrow and the next day<br />
                  maybe a future will begin to unfold<br />
                  mercurial dreams<br />
                  shaky and uncertain<br />
                  flickering, ever-changing<br />
                  perhaps fantastical<br />
                  and zealous<br />
                  but undoubtedly<br />
                  there<br />
                  i cannot tell you when<br />
                  why<br />
                  or how<br />
                  but i can guarantee<br />
                  that it is there<br />
                  waiting for you<br />
                  it will not be the life you dream of<br />
                  it is beyond comprehension<br />
                  beyond the words<br />
                  i can write.<br />
                  wait<br />
                  please<br />
                  wait<br />
                  you will see<br />
                  the present will no longer be there to survive<br />
                  but to live<br />
                  these ideas<br />
                  thoughts and fantasies<br />
                  forming slowly<br />
                  are yours to seize<br />
                  there is far too much to find<br />
                  to experience<br />
                  the crisp air in the morning<br />
                  the noon sunshine will heat<br />
                  you from the inside out<br />
                  and you will feel it<br />
                  all of it

                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>
                  This poem was inspired by the experience of being hospitalized
                  at a very young age. Christy Nolan's quotes made me reflect
                  about the fights and the difficulties we face every day to
                  make ourselves and others understand the pain we may
                  experience. It also sees suffering as a powerful source of
                  inspiration, rather than a limitation.

                  One day I woke up<br />
                  on a misty sun in winter<br />
                  the sun was burning,<br />
                  the sun was healing,<br />
                  like the truth told in a poem.<br />
                  One day I woke up,<br />
                  on a white meadow of thorny hopes.<br />
                  And I saw the pain,<br />
                  playing around with my future.<br />
                  Falling leaves in a quiet autumn,<br />
                  I felt the sterile words<br />
                  swim in a stream of sorrow.<br />
                  In a white room, all in white colour;<br />
                  an angel called<br />
                  and I asked,<br />
                  what if there's no tomorrow?<br />
                  On a white gown, down where red flowers follow.<br />
                  Should I give up this fight<br />
                  which life gives to the uncommon?<br />
                  Try to leave all behind,<br />
                  try to forgive the hollow.<br />
                  I am here,<br />
                  I survived.<br />
                  Believe me or try<br />
                  to judge the life<br />
                  I everyday defy.

                  The poem is effectively about how I am not special. It's kind

                  just another straight, upper-middle class white guy, and
                  really, I just do the same things as a million people before

                  I think I died one day.<br />
                  Yes, simple as that, <br />
                  My fine, fierce body and beating heart <br />
                  just Gave up. They had had enough.<br />
                  No time to waste! <br />
                  I think I went to heaven.<br /><br />

                  I met an old man there <br />
                  Called Lucifer.<br />
                  He was a horrible thing to look at. <br />
                  Decrepit and decayed, <br />
                  When he smiled <br />
                  His rotten gums held no teeth.<br /><br />

                  I gave a polite nod, <br />
                  Hoping he would leave, <br />
                  But he lingered and said in a dry voice,<br />
                  “I know you, young sir.”<br />
                  Doddery fool!<br />
                  I would tell him who I was. <br /><br />

                  I spoke of my triumphs <br />
                  And brilliant skills.<br />
                  “Knew me?” Doddery fool! I was unique. <br />
                  Better than the rest. <br />
                  But he smiled, <br />
                  And his black maw widened. <br /><br />

                  He listened patiently, then rose <br />
                  And bade me follow.<br />
                  So I did, and he led me to a stair <br />
                  That went forever, <br />
                  And bade me look.<br />
                  In arrogance, I did so. <br />

                  That was when I saw a <br />
                  Most appalling sight. <br />
                  Bodies. Thousands of dead, crumbling bodies. <br />
                  Floating in the void. <br />
                  Blank and broken, <br />
                  And they all shared my face. <br /><br />

                  Now I saw the old man <br />
                  His smile a black wound <br />
                  Stretching impossibly wide, <br />
                  And he whispered to me,<br /><br />

                  “Your life has been lived <br />
                  Long before you were born. <br />
                  And will be lived again <br />
                  Long after you are gone.” <br /><br />

                  I cringed in terror as the <br />
                  Infinite abyss <br />
                  Of Lucifer's laughing maw <br />
                  Became my world. <br />
                  And then, nothing. <br />
                  My life is lived. It will be lived again.

                <p>
                  Christy Nolan was noted as not just a writer but a creator of
                  words or portmanteau. This brought to mind the idea of a piano
                  in a picture, art creating art, creating art, in a still
                  silent echo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thank you for the opportunity to apply and I look forward to
                  the exhibition to come.
                </p>

                  My mother received a painting on her <br />
                  wedding day, another, back-straight at a piano <br />
                  Casting a shadow on the duties to her side; <br />
                  The dog, the unwashed floor, a baby looking <br />
                  at the world through new-soft lashes <br />
                  Her fingers set on the keys in firm submission.<br /><br />

                  No music fills my room of daily duty, <br />
                  but I am unfailingly captured by the voices, <br />
                  line by line by half-spun line. <br /><br />
                  Life, line, life, another / Life, line, life, another<br />
                  Reminiscent of the painting hung by my mother. <br /><br />

                  These voices are the key to my survival.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  In memory of Asperger's syndrome <br /><br />

                  Tell me doctor, do you think it proven <br />
                  that I bode some strange eruption to myself? <br />
                  Should I take it as a given that I'm broken <br />
                  and need some puzzle piece beyond my flesh? <br /><br />

                  But the only puzzling out here is in your work: <br />
                  slotting the disordered back in place. <br />
                  Do you ever stop and wonder what you're doing? <br />
                  Do you think that you can win the human race? <br /><br />

                  From what standard do you troubleshoot?<br />
                  How can you draw a starting line? <br />
                  And claim the highest definition, well <br />
                  in that case I'll define <br /><br />

                  the terms of my condition, now rewritten at the source:<br />
                  if my 'disorder' stems from anywhere, it trickles down, of
                  course! <br /><br />

                  And tell me DSM-5, was it not you who once labelled purer love
                  as mere disorder? Your attempt to “solve” me might be
                  well-spent considering why you label me “dysphoria”. or why
                  you label anything at all - I think you're haunted by a
                  spectre that cannot cure but classifies the ailments' as if
                  they were the hubris you've collected. but this taxonomy is
                  taxing me and takes reality to task: for its these
                  self-fulfilling prophecies that turn 'ability' to rank. So, if
                  we really heard how Autism Speaks, I've a hunch that it might
                  say: “well of course I'm overwhelmed, the world's in
                  disarray!”

                  I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the
                  Christy Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of
                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with
                  different mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital
                  tools—until I found the combination that best conveyed the
                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.
                  Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these
                  methods, the 2 experience ultimately helped me create a more
                  layered, visually engaging artwork that truly represents my
                  journey.

                  How did the Christy Nolan quote you chose to use influence the
                  direction or meaning of your work, and why did you feel it

                <p>
                  I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words
                  echo with truth,' because it captures the tension between
                  feeling unheard and knowing our experiences still carry
                  weight. As someone who uses alternative communication methods,
                  I've often felt that my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I
                  believe that even the quiet or unconventional ways we express
                  ourselves can resonate powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave
                  me the confidence to highlight this quiet strength in my
                  piece—conveying how, despite the seeming 'silence,' our truths
                  can create ripples of understanding and empathy in others.

                  "Zealous mercurial dreams were about to be realized." (p.151)

                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p>
                  I submitted an original oil painting of mine. This piece
                  relates to the quotation 'Zealous mercurial dreams were about
                  to be realized.'. This piece represents the excitement and
                  unpredictability of dreams about to be realised. The red
                  underpainting was chosen to symbolise the passion and
                  intensity of the dreams. It creates a warm but theatrical
                  composition. The bending road represents the unpredictable and
                  changing nature of the dreams, why is the road bending and
                  where does it lead to? The smaller three paths present in the
                  composition represent the notion of choice, which path will be
                  chosen and where will it take you. This reinforces the notion
                  of change. The backward sign symbolises the unconventional
                  route to success. The sign which is supposed to provide
                  direction is facing the wrong way, this suggests that
                  following traditional paths might not lead you to the
                  realisation of your dreams. The sign signifies the idea that
                  sometimes in order for your big dreams to come true you must
                  follow your own intuition and ignore external expectations.
                  The painting also captures a certain volatility that is most
                  prominent in the sky itself. The tension is signified by the
                  stormy sky and dark clouds. The moment of realisation is
                  captured by the state of the sky. Initially we see a
                  tumultuous sky however when you look closer you notice the two
                  white spots either side of the piece. The white spots signify
                  a hopefulness, a shift in mood and a change that is about to
                  occur. The storm is passing, the clouds are clearing and the
                  dreams are about to be realised.

                <p>
                  Deep into my medical exams, I realized that I had been so
                  caught up in memorizing science, facts, anatomy, that I lost
                  track of what really mattered: trying every day to help
                  someone heal. My piece was a reminder to myself that
                  understanding a heart is meaningless if you don't acknowledge
                  and love the human around it.
