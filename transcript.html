                <h4>
                  How did the Christy Nolan quote you chose to use influence the
                  direction or meaning of your work, and why did you feel it
                  resonated with your personal experiences?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words
                  echo with truth,' because it captures the tension between
                  feeling unheard and knowing our experiences still carry
                  weight. As someone who uses alternative communication methods,
                  I've often felt that my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I
                  believe that even the quiet or unconventional ways we express
                  ourselves can resonate powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave
                  me the confidence to highlight this quiet strength in my
                  piece—conveying how, despite the seeming 'silence,' our truths
                  can create ripples of understanding and empathy in others.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  What was your process for developing the piece, and did you
                  encounter any particular challenges - whether artistic,
                  technical, or related to accessibility - that shaped the final
                  result?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the
                  Christy Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of
                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with
                  different mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital
                  tools—until I found the combination that best conveyed the
                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.
                  Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these
                  methods, the 2 experience ultimately helped me create a more
                  layered, visually engaging artwork that truly represents my
                  journey.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  In exploring perseverance, identity, and creative expression,
                  what core message or insight do you hope viewers, readers, or
                  listeners will take away from your piece?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I hope that my piece reminds people that perseverance is not
                  just about pushing through difficult circumstances—it's also
                  about embracing your own story and identity in the process. By
                  weaving together visuals and narration that reflect personal
                  growth, I wanted to show how creative expression can transform
                  our struggles into something powerful and unifying.
                  Ultimately, my aim is for anyone experiencing the work to feel
                  seen and encouraged to use their own voice, recognizing that
                  every unique perspective adds depth and beauty to our shared
                  human experience.

                  I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the
                  Christy Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of
                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with

                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.
                  Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these

                  How did the Christy Nolan quote you chose to use influence the
                  direction or meaning of your work, and why did you feel it
                  resonated with your personal experiences?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words
                  echo with truth,' because it captures the tension between
                  feeling unheard and knowing our experiences still carry
                  weight. As someone who uses alternative communication methods,
                  I've often felt that my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I
                  believe that even the quiet or unconventional ways we express
                  ourselves can resonate powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave
                  me the confidence to highlight this quiet strength in my
                  piece—conveying how, despite the seeming 'silence,' our truths
                  can create ripples of understanding and empathy in others.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  What was your process for developing the piece, and did you
                  encounter any particular challenges - whether artistic,
                  technical, or related to accessibility - that shaped the final
                  result?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the
                  Christy Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of
                  resilience and self-discovery. From there, I experimented with
                  different mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital
                  tools—until I found the combination that best conveyed the
                  idea of emerging strength. One significant challenge I faced
                  was adapting my workspace to accommodate my physical
                  limitations: I needed specialized tools with better grip and
                  ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in turn, led me to
                  explore more tactile techniques and texture in my piece.
                  Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these
                  methods, the 2 experience ultimately helped me create a more
                  layered, visually engaging artwork that truly represents my
                  journey.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  In exploring perseverance, identity, and creative expression,
                  what core message or insight do you hope viewers, readers, or
                  listeners will take away from your piece?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  I hope that my piece reminds people that perseverance is not
                  just about pushing through difficult circumstances—it's also
                  about embracing your own story and identity in the process. By
                  weaving together visuals and narration that reflect personal
                  growth, I wanted to show how creative expression can transform
                  our struggles into something powerful and unifying.
                  Ultimately, my aim is for anyone experiencing the work to feel
                  seen and encouraged to use their own voice, recognizing that
                  every unique perspective adds depth and beauty to our shared
                  human experience.
