              <h3>A Brief Overview of Christy Nolan</h3>
              <p>
                Christopher Nolan (6 September 1965 - 20 February 2009), often
                called “Christy,” was an Irish poet and novelist who overcame
                the challenges of severe cerebral palsy to craft an
                extraordinary body of work that resonated with readers around
                the world. Born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, he famously used
                a “unicorn stick” attached to his forehead to type,
                demonstrating both his remarkable determination and inventive
                spirit. He published his first collection of poetry and prose,
                Dam-Burst of Dreams, as a teenager, then gained international
                acclaim with his autobiographical novel Under the Eye of the
                Clock, which won the prestigious Whitbread Award (now the Costa
                Book Awards). Nolan's lyrical style and distinctive perspective
                also shone in his later novel, The Banyan Tree, helping cement
                his reputation as a vital voice in Irish literature. Despite his
                physical limitations, Nolan's unwavering commitment to
                self-expression continues to inspire readers and writers alike,
                underscoring the resilience and boundless creativity of the
                human spirit.

                  The Old Library at Trinity College Dublin is one of Ireland's
                  most iconic cultural landmarks, housing the world-renowned
                  Book of Kells and the magnificent Long Room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visiting the Old Library is a deeply sensory experience. Upon
                  entering, the scent of old books and polished wood fills the
                  air, evoking a sense of history and tradition. The ground
                  floor, where the Book of Kells exhibition is housed, is often
                  bustling with activity, creating a lively atmosphere. However,
                  the lighting is carefully controlled to protect the
                  manuscripts, resulting in a calm, subdued environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> The Long Room building has no student
                  spaces.

                  The Old Library is accessible at all levels, ensuring that all
                  visitors can experience its treasures. The main entrance
                  features stone-built ramps on both the east and west sides,
                  providing wheelchair access to the building. The double front

                  mobility throughout the ground floor public spaces. For more

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The "Perseverance Through Words" competition celebrates Christy
          Nolan's legacy and empowers disabled students and staff at Trinity
          College Dublin to showcase their creativity. The event includes a
          competition launch, a midpoint workshop, and a final celebration
          featuring winning submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christy Nolan (1965-2009) remains a shining example of Irish
          creativity and literature. At just fifteen, he published his first
          poetry collection, Dam-Burst of Dreams, followed by his memoir, Under
          the Eye of the Clock, and later the critically acclaimed novel The
          Banyan Tree. During his time at Trinity College Dublin, Christy's
          disability was welcomed and he found the support he needed to thrive.
          Now, in recognition of his archival works being displayed in the Long
          Room at Trinity and to celebrate 25 years of the disAbility Service,
          we invite disabled staff and students at Trinity to share their
          creative talents in a competition open to all art forms—literary,
          visual, film, and performance. The winning works will be showcased in
          the “Old Library, New Treasures” exhibition and honored at a special
          event celebrating Christy's life.

              Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised
            </h3>
            <p>
              "Zealous Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised" is inspired
              by the work of Christy Nolan, the extraordinary Irish author and
              poet who overcame his challenges of cerebral palsy to create
              impactful Irish literature. His dedication to his artistic voice
              and the power of his words stand as a testament to the human drive
              to communicate and create. Growing up with dyslexia meant that I
              often struggled with finding the beauty and enjoyment of the
              written word. Instead, I discovered a relationship with music,
              learning through listening and feeling. Music became a language
              that spoke to me with a clarity, a world where my understanding
              flourished through sound and emotion. This piece, "Zealous
              Mercurial Dreams Were About to Be Realised," in its energetic
              bursts and fluid shifts, reflects a journey of discovery of
              expression. The "zealous" quality speaks to the passionate drive
              to create and express, while the "mercurial" nature embodies the
              freedom and fluidity I found in connecting with music on my own
              terms. Ultimately, this piece is an expression of the joy and
              liberation found in the expression of language. It's offered as a
              tribute to the spirit of Christy Nolan and a reflection of my own
              unique path towards the joy of language.

              I have written a personal essay about how I got through an
              especially sunny day as an albino. On many occasions, the sunlight
              is manageable but on many, it isn't. That's what happened during a
              bookshop-run and I've tried to capture how I made it to my
              destination without bumping into a fellow human or a pole. It also
              captures how I am comfortable and proud telling everyone about my
              condition, which didn't happen overnight, but I am glad that it
              has eventually.

              Avantika Singhal ~ Peronal Essay
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong> This submission presents a personal
              essay titled “Personal Essay Submission” by Avantika Singhal,
              reflecting on lived experiences of albinism, identity, and
              navigating everyday encounters in Dublin. Written in a lyrical,
              introspective tone, the piece captures a moment of personal
              vulnerability and empowerment.

              <br />
              <br />There's panic. <br />
              There's hesitation. And, there's one recurring thought - you all
              are just silhouettes to me: black, mobile, and unpredictable.
              <br />
              <br />I let this thought consume me as I stand in the sharp Irish
              sunlight on a street somewhere in St. Stephen's Green, shielding
              my eyes despite wearing sunglasses. Can I see anything clearly?
              No. You all are a blur and by “you” I mean all the Dubliners
              spreading in all directions, going about their day - oblivious to
              a middle-aged albino girl who can't seem to see straight despite
              eye protection.<br />
              <br />
              This happens more than you'd expect. Usually, when I am alone, I
              walk it off, praying that the sunbeams become kinder in time and
              that I can make my way to my destination without being run over or
              pushed down on the buzzing pavements. However, when I am walking
              with someone, say a friend or family member and the Sun is
              reaching unprecedented heights, my pace slows, my steps falter and
              the eye-shielding is ten times more vigorous.<br />
              <br />
              Today, the Sun is a little less forgiving even though I am alone.
              By some miracle and a sprinkle of perseverance, I push through the
              shapes and successfully make my way to Books Upstairs, an
              unmistakably blue bookshop labelled as “Ireland's oldest”. The
              need to be surrounded by books is all-consuming at this juncture
              of time and space and it also gives me a chance to hide from the
              Sun.<br />
              <br />
              I enter gracelessly and my demeanour changes instantly. The
              colours, the titles, the bookworms - oh so tempting! But am I here
              to splurge on a trending hardcover? No. The reason why I am here
              is because I am somewhat of a Hot Chocolate connoisseur and I must
              test all the milky-chocolatey concoctions I can get my glove-clad
              hands on.<br />
              <br />
              I make my way upstairs (no book in hand, mind you) and awkwardly
              order my forever-favourite beverage. The barista is a 20-something
              college-going girl who couldn't stop yapping about the latest
              Hunger Games book before I ordered. That was until she wasn't
              riveted by my accent - which is an inauthentic and
              not-so-compelling mixture of Indian and American. However, she is
              invested now, and asks me without preamble, “Where are you
              from?”<br />
              <br />
              Here we go again. Time to explain how someone with ginger hair (I
              dye it), violet, nystagmus-riddled eyes, and a pale complexion
              sounds like an Indian. Where is she from?!, her brain must be
              toiling to trace my roots. <br />
              <br />
              I tend to cherish and detest such interactions. There have been so
              many ever since I came to Dublin that I can almost predict how the
              person is going to react to my origin story. Once I solve the
              mystery for them, I do feel liberated; like I have just reinstated
              to myself that I am comfortable in my skin. <br />
              <br />
              I offer her a brief explanation gently, “India, but I am
              albino.”<br />
              <br />
              It's no surprise when she raises her eyebrows and opens her mouth
              in an 'o' shape. Yes, yes, cue the surprise. She has finally
              spotted an Indian-looking Irish young woman in the modern-day
              wilderness. Huzza!<br />
              <br />
              Within seconds, the shocked 'o' turns into an understanding 'o'
              and she hands me my drink with a tiny smile on her face. She's
              absorbing the information and trying to be polite at the same
              time. I get it. I always do.<br />
              <br />
              I should have never existed. Yet I do. I am the best kind of
              anomaly. One that knocks you off your feet and forces you to
              reconsider what you think you know about biology, considering both
              my parents wear brown skins back home with pride and love.<br />
              <br />
              Albinism is a hindrance sometimes. Crossing the road, reading tiny
              fonts, spotting someone from afar…But it's also a gift and the
              biggest gift I can give myself is the gift of self-acceptance.
              <br />
              <br />I may not have superpowers but I still possess the ability
              to stupefy people with my looks and my genealogy. For me, it
              doesn't get better than that.

              The poem is about being someones confidant but it can be
              interpreted in many ways. One interpretation is the secret being
              something malicious but being unable to say it, another is that
              the temptation to share a secret is a curse in itself. Regardless,
              the character is no fool.

              I'd ne'er thrust your trust into ash <br />
              Nor feed it to our peers <br />
              To be shared among vultures <br />
              Gnawing corpses <br />
              To be spread like a plague <br />
              Grating sores For truth is a virtue seldom known <br />
              And your secret a thing for you and I alone
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope you know I hate you <br />
              And the penance you give so readily<br />
              Each day I seam my lips tight <br />
              But I feel it tempt me so <br />
              To speak your truth <br />
              Both kind and foul <br />
              But a confidant is a curse well known <br />
              So, I'll keep my slit tongue carefully sewn
            </p>
            <p>
              But care you do the same my friend<br />
              For liars meet a far worse end<br />
              And if I knew what you'd say back then<br />
              I'd slit my ears to ne'er hear again

              Upon hearing about the competition and learning about Christopher
              Nolan, I chose to read Under the Eye of the Clock in its entirety
              to get a better sense of who we are honoring. My piece is a
              40-line poem, inspired not only by the quotes provided but by
              Nolan's memoir and his story as a whole. As someone with an
              invisible disability I can never know what it is like to have a
              visible disability, but I can know and understand the inner pain,
              fight, and isolation that comes with a disability in itself - and
              I can only hope that I did well in honoring Nolan and his legacy
              through my poem.

              no echo, no voice<br />
              yet you are seen.

              Sundrenched ichor spots off the spine<br />

            <p class="text-start">
              When I was 7, I learned the sun would explode one day.<br />
              It hit me really hard, <br />
              as if my dad had said we would all die tomorrow.<br />
              He laughed, “5 billion years from now. <br />
              We'll both be dead.” <br />
              That's true. <br />
              I hadn't thought of that. <br />
              And at the time, I remembered evolution and dinosaurs. <br />
              I had learned more in a few years than I ever would again. <br />
              And two of the things I learned were that dinosaurs lived here 200
              million years ago and that <br />
              they were awesome. <br />
              200 million was not even close to 5 billion. <br />
              I'd been around for 7. <br />
              That day was one of revelation. <br />
              My family and I were not the universe, <br />
              just one of many. <br />
              I couldn't believe that it was possible nothing from me would
              definitively exist at an exact, <br />
              inescapable moment. <br />
              Sometimes I feel that way about relationships. <br />
              Sometimes I feel that way with you. That we exist in some seconds
              of childlike confusion after hearing an inconceivable truth;
              <br />
              that a day will come when no trace of us can be found in the
              other.<br />
              As I stare into my lovers' eyes each,<br />
              "There will come a day that I forget you."

              This piece is a reflection on a journey with depression, spanning
              over several years. It explores the emergence from a place of
              darkness, a place where the future felt unreachable, where it
              becomes difficult to recognise yourself, and existence itself
              becomes a quiet battle. It aims to articulate the almost
              imperceptible return to life, the long-awaited escape from mere
              survival. It was inspired by Christy Nolan's ability to write with
              such emotional clarity and resilience, I wanted to honour the
              achievement of surviving, and to acknowledge the beauty but also
              the fear of moving beyond into a life that you almost forgot
              existed - where mercurial dreams, once too impossible to
              contemplate, begin to form. 'to tomorrow, and tomorrow' is a
              letter to a former self and perhaps a future self, with a promise
              that life can, and will be, more. I hope it speaks to the
              experience of living with a hidden disability but also celebrates
              the power of creativity and self-expression to propel us forward
              when words and life itself feel too far away to reach, something
              that has undoubtedly helped me over the years.

            <p class="text-start">
              here<br />
              a breath caught in my throat<br />
              taken aback<br />
              by it all<br />
              23 was an impossibility<br />
              no future<br />
              nor light<br />
              shrouded by a constant darkness<br />
              penetrated only by the weight<br />
              of living<br />
              at war<br />
              an attack from within<br />
              clawed hands ripping at my mind<br />
              its jagged edges<br />
              cutting through the soft flesh<br />
              of my chest<br />
              spilling<br />
              losing hope<br />
              leaking<br />
              slowly<br />
              slowly<br />
              slowly<br />
              drawing out brilliance<br />
              leaving a<br />
              sparkless<br />
              dull<br />
              shell<br />
              how long does it take for scars to heal<br />
              i cannot give you an exact<br />
              timeline<br />
              i wish i could tell you<br />
              by day 912<br />
              that<br />
              wounds will begin to repair<br />
              muscles will knit together<br />
              skin will reach across and embrace<br />
              connected once again<br />
              the drip will slow<br />
              and inevitably stop<br />
              i cannot tell you this<br />
              but<br />
              there will be a day<br />
              when you will realise<br />
              that there are emotions on the fringes<br />
              at the edge of the abyss<br />
              tentatively creeping<br />
              toward your mind<br />
              your heart<br />
              they will slowly pry open<br />
              doors you thought<br />
              were long bolted shut<br />
              and the darkness<br />
              will not be so black<br />
              it will slowly transform<br />
              bursting with purples<br />
              blue and green<br />
              hues that have been forgotten<br />
              breaking across your minds eye<br />
              as beautiful as a dawn<br />
              a world will open before you<br />
              misshapen and blunt<br />
              and it will be yours<br />
              all yours<br />
              there will be music to feel<br />
              views to drink in<br />
              stories to tell<br />
              and questions to ask<br />
              laughs that will give you pains, such pleasant pains<br />
              tears that will feel like a blessing<br />
              love to offer<br />
              and love to accept<br />
              albeit a hesitating hand<br />
              but you are so deserving of it<br />
              so deserving<br />
              you always have been<br />
              always<br />
              your days will extend<br />
              you will finally see beyond the night<br />
              to tomorrow and tomorrow and the next day<br />
              maybe a future will begin to unfold<br />
              mercurial dreams<br />
              shaky and uncertain<br />
              flickering, ever-changing<br />
              perhaps fantastical<br />
              and zealous<br />
              but undoubtedly<br />
              there<br />
              i cannot tell you when<br />
              why<br />
              or how<br />
              but i can guarantee<br />
              that it is there<br />
              waiting for you<br />
              it will not be the life you dream of<br />
              it is beyond comprehension<br />
              beyond the words<br />
              i can write.<br />
              wait<br />
              please<br />
              wait<br />
              you will see<br />
              the present will no longer be there to survive<br />
              but to live<br />
              these ideas<br />
              thoughts and fantasies<br />
              forming slowly<br />
              are yours to seize<br />
              there is far too much to find<br />
              to experience<br />
              the crisp air in the morning<br />
              the noon sunshine will heat<br />
              you from the inside out<br />
              and you will feel it<br />
              all of it

              This poem was inspired by the experience of being hospitalized at
              a very young age. Christy Nolan's quotes made me reflect about the
              fights and the difficulties we face everyday to make ourselves and
              others understand the pain we may experience. It also sees
              suffering as a powerful source of inspiration, rather than a
              limitation.

              One day I woke up<br />

              Falling leaves in a quiet autumn,<br />

              In a white room, all in white colour;<br />

              The poem is effectively about how I am not special. It's kind of
              angry, because as much as I'd like to think I'm unique, I'm just
              another straight, upper-middle class white guy, and really, I just
              do the same things as a million people before me.

              <strong><u>End </u></strong><br />

              I think I died one day. <br />

              Yes, simple as that, <br />

              My fine, fierce body and beating heart just <br />

              Gave up. They had had enough. <br />

              No time to waste! <br />

              I think I went to heaven. <br /><br />

              I met an old man there <br />

              Called Lucifer. <br />

              He was a horrible thing to look at. <br />

              Decrepit and decayed, <br />

              When he smiled <br />

              His rotten gums held no teeth. <br /><br />

              I gave a polite nod, <br />

              Hoping he would leave, <br />

              But he lingered and said in a dry voice, <br />

              “I know you, young sir.” <br />

              Doddery fool! <br />

              I would tell him who I was. <br /><br />

              I spoke of my triumphs <br />

              And brilliant skills. <br />

              “Knew me?” Doddery fool! I was unique. <br />

              Better than the rest. <br />

              But he smiled, <br />

              And his black maw widened. <br /><br />

              He listened patiently, then rose <br />

              And bade me follow. <br />

              So I did, and he led me to a stair <br />

              That went forever, <br />

              And bade me look. <br />

              In arrogance, I did so. <br /><br />

              That was when I saw a <br />

              Most appalling sight. <br />

              Bodies. Thousands of dead, crumbling bodies. <br />

              Floating in the void. <br />

              Blank and broken, <br />

              And they all shared my face. <br /><br />

              Now I saw the old man <br />

              His smile a black wound <br />

              Stretching impossibly wide, <br />

              And he whispered to me, <br /><br />

              “Your life has been lived <br />

              Long before you were born. <br />

              And will be lived again <br />

              Long after you are gone.” <br /><br />

              I cringed in terror as the <br />

              Infinite abyss <br />

              Of Lucifer's laughing maw <br />

              Became my world. <br />

              And then, nothing. <br />

              My life is lived. It will be lived again.

              Christy Nolan was noted as not just a writer but a creator of
              words or portmanteau. This brought to mind the idea of a piano in
              a picture, art creating art, creating art, in a still silent echo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for the opportunity to apply and I look forward to the
              exhibition to come.

              My mother received a painting on her<br />

              The dog, the unwashed floor, a baby looking<br />
              at the world through new-soft lashes<br />
              Her fingers set on the keys in firm submission.<br /><br />

              No music fills my room of daily duty, but I<br />
              am unfailingly captured by the voices, line<br />

              Tell me doctor, do you think it proven<br />

              slotting the disordered back in place.<br />
              Do you ever stop and wonder what you're doing?<br />
              Do you think that you can win the human race?<br /><br />
              From what standard do you troubleshoot?<br />

              And claim the highest definition, well<br />
              in that case I'll define <br /><br />
              the terms of my condition, now rewritten at the source:<br />
              if my 'disorder' stems from anywhere, it trickles down, of
              course!<br /><br />
              And tell me DSM-5, was it not you who<br />
              once labelled purer love as mere disorder?<br />
              Your attempt to “solve” me might be well-spent<br />
              considering why you label me “dysphoria”.<br /><br />
              or why you label anything at all -<br />
              I think you're haunted by a spectre<br />
              that cannot cure but classifies the ailments'<br />
              as if they were the hubris you've collected.<br /><br />
              but this taxonomy is taxing me <br />
              and takes reality to task:<br />
              for its these self-fulfilling prophecies<br />
              that turn 'ability' to rank. <br /><br />
              So, if we really heard how Autism Speaks,<br />
              I've a hunch that it might say:<br />

              This video is a poem I created about discovering I had ADHD at 18
              years old. It reflects how I've always dreamt big but struggled to
              follow through with tasks, and how, once diagnosed, it helped me
              accept myself and experience an awakening. I shot the footage on
              my GoPro, and the accompanying song is 'Breathtaker' by SYML. This
              journey I went on mirrors Christy Nolan's sentiment: 'Now could he
              ever get his chance to let folk see what they thought never
              existed?' (p.53), as I began to unveil a part of myself previously
              hidden.

              I spent my life just wondering why<br />
              Lost in thought as time flew by <br />
              Forgot the task <br />
              But not the dream <br />
              Always drifting in between <br />
              You should focus just sit still<br />
              But my mind had its own will <br />
              Scattered thoughts <br />
              A restless spark<br />
              A hidden fire in the dark <br />
              Then one day and name a key <br />
              You're not broken <br />
              Just wired differently <br />
              Now, I know <br />

            </h3>
            <p class="text-start">
              He was buried with a watch that still ticks.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              His wife knew their son was in vain, often. And she remembered how
              they walked, herding the cattle, and how her son came home with
              secrets. His secrets were his own and they would take up space in
              his heart. She thought of the day they walked and she watched. How
              beautiful and violent! The man whom she shared her child with, the
              child who was half of her and half of him, beat their son with a
              handful of flowers. How soft and angry! How her son walked on with
              grace in his step. But how she could hear the quiet sounds he made
              at night when darkness was a friend. But now that the dead were
              fallen, and had no chance to rise up, those quiet sounds grew into
              forests where thousands of birds squawked and flapped their wings
              in rivers where women had drowned.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              How she'd say to her husband, 'You know, he is a hill of emotion,
              bursting to come off that hill. You must let him live. You must
              let him breathe without fear of his own breath.' Now she was
              saying to him, 'Can you breathe down there in your grave we dug by
              hand?'
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              He shouts at her through layers of dirt, 'I wasn't ready to go. I
              couldn't be as I wished. Will you bring me back up? Will you just
              take your shovel, and let me out. You put me in here with that son
              of ours, now will you just come together to lift me out. I'm not
              that heavy, really, I've only been eating sweets for the last
              year. I've already lost some tissue and skin, it won't be too
              difficult to just lift me out. I'll come back and repair all that
              we lost, or all that we never had. We can start again.'
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              And his son was reincarnation of a cow. And all through his
              father's death, the son felt, 'I am the cow and my father is the
              crow picking at my back… the flies picking at my eyes and cow coat
              of skin.'
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              'I never laid a finger on you, but I think today may be your day,
              boy!' The dead man's son starts remembering all the past memories
              of violence and strife. His father looks down at his watch in the
              grave.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              His son sits above his father for the first time. 'It's time for
              me to come out, now, son.' But his back was turned to his son in
              his grave and his son couldn't hear him. But in that same moment,
              the son looks down at his watch, which shows the same time, and
              thinks, 'It was time. Time for you. Time for me. Now it is time
              for me to let go of these past memories. It's time for me to live.
              I've buried with you all those times of violence and strife, and
              it quietly ticks in this cow's heart.'
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              His son licks envelopes that hold thanks inside for the people
              wishing condolences upon them. He enjoys licking the envelopes to
              better the smell on his breath which holds tastes of death, the
              taste of dirt, the taste of his father.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              The taste of vomit from all the food of reunion. A supper that
              lasted so long it was meant to keep secrets buried, to keep the
              food down. But as soon as the dead man's house, which he no longer
              inhabited, was empty, mother and son reunited alone, his son
              vomits up all their past.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              'Your father… your father, he'd cover himself up in silence. You'd
              cover yourself up in words. You'd be waiting for him to be
              different. Some people though, some people stay the same forever,
              and are content. Some people like it that way. You'll always be
              waiting, son. Even now that he's in the grave, you'll be waiting
              for your mind to fix a different memory of him.'' A mother
              comforts her child and holds him in her arms, like the pietá.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              He could feel the bodies walking above him. And all his silence
              wanted to burst from inside him. His son was the only one who
              thought, 'Will the dead mind us standing on them like this, like
              the way we do, and have always done?'' A father rests in his
              grave, wrought with a grave grief for the life he lived, and the
              lives he created for his wife and child.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              'Our boy, my boy whose friends were moaning seals. Good man, my
              son. My son who dug his father's grave. Who once dug a grave for a
              big, old cow and laid him to rest with gentleness. We do be
              getting violent with each other and I'd make him dig up a past his
              eyes should never see. Now I have the words to say, 'I'm sorry.
              I'm sorry for all that past. Our past. I'm sorry for those times
              of violence and strife.' But now, now, he cannot hear me.'
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              In his grave, on this hill, his eyes let out emotion, and water
              the dirt with his tears. He looks down at his watch, in his grave.
              And the ticking stops.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              The son's watch kept ticking. And the voices of his father
              stopped. Relief. The boy's familiarity with burying cows and a man
              formed him and his life. He buries the dead until his end.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              He knows he's burying secrets. But he doesn't know what they are.
              He is content with this unknowing but decides to fix a memory of
              each life of each corpse in his mind. He holds all these stories
              close to his heart. Especially those who came alone, or left
              alone, like himself. He made sure to remember every corpse in
              every plot, marking his heart with words of them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              These secrets sit in the dark and water the dirt with their tears,
              or their joy.
            </p>

              His mother's body was the only body he refused to bury. Because he
              could not accept her death. He struggled to vomit up the idea of
              her gone. All that was left of him and his life were the cattle
              and the bodies beneath the earth he walked on. He tried to recall
              every word of his mother, but could not.

            <p class="text-start">
              All his life he worked alone, until he could no longer work at
              all. All the cattle were either sold or buried. And his father's
              house, desolate, was bought up along with all the land, by the
              city council. He was now stuck in a care home, that was paid for
              by every plot he dug.

              And then there was herself. She worked in the older folks care
              home, even though she herself was an older folk and as old as the
              rest of them. She seemed to outlive all the older folks. Skin grew
              around her wounds both external and internal, like a cowhide. So
              she too had been familiar with death. They were both seen as
              nobility by the people in the town. They both believed their work
              to be good and decent work since they did not feel they ever
              destroyed anything. But there was her, always giving him expired
              supplements that had lost their potency and integrity. In his
              passing hour, there she was, sitting beside him and could hear
              sounds of a distant seal moan.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">There he goes, goes, sitting expired.</p>
            <p class="text-start">
              Somehow, the ground would not break initially for his death. He
              was not ready to meet his father again, or his mother. He was laid
              to rest with a shovel. The same shovel he used to dig for the cow,
              his father, and every subsequent grave. One could say he'd dig
              eternally.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">
              He lies beside his father and mother with a watch that still
              ticked. And one day it stop. And with him, in his chamber, in a
              grave dug by hand, were all those secrets nearly lost, now lost.

            <h3 class="fw-bold text-accessible-pink">Description:</h3>
            <p>
              I submitted an original oil painting of mine. This piece relates
              to the quotation 'Zealous mercurial dreams were about to be
              realized.'. This piece represents the excitement and
              unpredictability of dreams about to be realised. The red
              underpainting was chosen to symbolise the passion and intensity of
              the dreams. It creates a warm but theatrical composition. The
              bending road represents the unpredictable and changing nature of
              the dreams, why is the road bending and where does it lead to? The
              smaller three paths present in the composition represent the
              notion of choice, which path will be chosen and where will it take
              you. This reinforces the notion of change. The backward sign
              symbolises the unconventional route to success. The sign which is
              supposed to provide direction is facing the wrong way, this
              suggests that following traditional paths might not lead you to
              the realisation of your dreams. The sign signifies the idea that
              sometimes in order for your big dreams to come true you must
              follow your own intuition and ignore external expectations. The
              painting also captures a certain volatility that is most prominent
              in the sky itself. The tension is signified by the stormy sky and
              dark clouds. The moment of realisation is captured by the state of
              the sky. Initially we see a tumultuous sky however when you look
              closer you notice the two white spots either side of the piece.
              The white spots signify a hopefulness, a shift in mood and a
              change that is about to occur. The storm is passing, the clouds
              are clearing and the dreams are about to be realised.

            <p>
              Deep into my medical exams, I realized that I had been so caught
              up in memorizing science, facts, anatomy, that I lost track of
              what really mattered: trying every day to help someone heal. My
              piece was a reminder to myself that understanding a heart is
              meaningless if you don't acknowledge and love the human around it.

              Only do we give the world its meaning,<br />

              It has no care for our meanings,<br />
              Yet, without us, there is nothing.

            <p>
              And so we exist to exist, <br />
              The world ends once we do, <br />
              Yet we have no power over it, <br />
              And we never will.

              So when you raised your sword to them,<br />

              Anger and eternal solitude.

            <p>
              Yet, did you even try? <br />
              The moment they drew their swords, <br />
              You merely answered with your own.
            </p>
            <p>And what will it cost you?</p>
            <p>
              With all the power in the world <br />
              I cannot even prevent a wave <br />

            <p>Yet I can choose to try</p>
            <p>
              For without you, like this world,<br />
              I am nothing-<br />

            <p><strong>Hidden Heritage</strong></p>
            <p>
              I was fourteen when I stumbled upon a hidden part of my identity.
              As I hopped onto the bus for school, I noticed someone walking
              from the back and taking the empty seat in front of me. He didn't
              sit; he knelt on the seat, threw his arms over the back, and
              looked at me. He asked who my mother was, and when I told him, he
              replied that my grandfather was his uncle. I didn't know what to
              say. Why hadn't my mother mentioned we had relations in Roscommon?
              The boy looked familiar, but I was sure I'd never met him before.
              Two girls behind me giggled and whispered “tinker,” a word I
              didn't understand; I didn't think it was directed at me or the
              boy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The boy continued, saying we were second cousins. I was
              speechless, unsure of how to respond. When the bus stopped, he
              smirked and hopped off. The two girls looked me up and down with a
              dirty look. I didn't understand why, but I thought it might have
              been because of the boy. In school, I considered asking my friend
              if she knew him, but without a name, it seemed impossible. After
              the girls' reaction, I was reluctant to find out, in case it made
              things worse.
            </p>
            <p>
              At lunch, while walking to the shop with my friend, I saw the boy
              outside. I quickly avoided eye contact, hoping he hadn't seen me.
              But when I left the shop, he called me by name. I pretended not to
              hear him and kept walking. My friend asked how I knew him, and I
              told her he was just some guy from the bus, not mentioning what he
              had said. Her response shocked me. “If he weren't a Traveller,
              he'd be good-looking. Wouldn't put him on my shift list though.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Until that moment, I thought a Traveller was just someone who
              travelled from place to place. But I quickly realised there was
              another kind of Traveller—one that people avoided and badmouthed.
              I asked my friend his name and what exactly a Traveller was. She
              said, “He's McDonagh. Travellers live in caravans or on the side
              of the road, but they're nothing but trouble. Always fighting.”
            </p>
            <p>
              I was confused. How could this boy be related to me if he were a
              Traveller? Does that mean the surname McDonagh is a Traveller
              name? Alarm bells went off. My mother's maiden name was
              McDonagh—the same as my birth certificate. My mother had
              registered me at school under my dad's surname because she said
              it'd make things easier. Was she ashamed of McDonagh because it
              was a Traveller surname, or was it just a coincidence?
            </p>
            <p>
              I always knew McDonagh was her dad's surname, but she had little
              to do with him after he left for England when she was four. When
              he returned, she saw him a few times and introduced me to him as
              his first granddaughter. I remember one visit when I was four, we
              went to a caravan park. I thought it was a camping site and was
              fascinated that people could live in caravans year-round. I
              remember an old lady sitting in an armchair outside. (That woman
              turned out to be my great-grandmother.) My grandfather died when I
              was six, and after that, my mother had little contact with his
              side of the family. I don't recall anyone ever mentioning that he
              was a Traveller.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of the school day, I'd more questions than answers. I
              asked my mother if McDonaghs were Travellers. She laughed it off
              first, eventually admitting it. I didn't know how to take it. My
              heart drummed hard, and my world felt like it was turning upside
              down. How had I not known about our heritage? Why had my family
              hidden it?
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time, my mother warned me not to tell anyone, explaining
              that Travellers were often mistreated. I spent the night wondering
              how different my life might have been if my mother had stayed
              close to her father's family. Would I have been treated
              differently if people knew? I was always picked on in school, so I
              sympathised with others who were isolated or bullied. I thought
              about Patrick, a boy in my class who people called “a smelly
              knacker”—a term I now understood was aimed at Travellers. He often
              sat alone, but one day, I sat beside him, and someone across the
              room commented about him being “too stupid,” and to cover my work,
              or he'd copy it. I ignored it and sat beside him anyway, and he
              did look at my copy for English. I let him because Maths was my
              weak subject, and he'd help me with that. I was glad I didn't know
              he was a Traveller because I might have felt sorry for him for
              that reason alone, but in the end, I just saw him as someone who
              was struggling academically, like I was.
            </p>
            <p>
              It took me years to process what I had learned about my heritage.
              During my Master's, I realised I'd been living in denial, ashamed
              of my surname. At eighteen, I even changed it by deed poll to my
              stepfather's surname, but it never felt quite right. When I
              started my PhD, my student card arrived with my birth surname
              printed on it, and it sent me into a panic. But then, I embraced
              it, feeling a sense of pride in an academic environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, when I decided to focus my thesis on Travellers and my
              family's history, it became a pivotal moment—a decision to stop
              hiding from my heritage. This led me to a deeper understanding of
              my roots, my family's story, and who I really am. I began to
              realise I shared more with my grandfather—a man I met only a
              handful of times—than I did with my parents. He had a
              determination in him that I inherited, having taught himself to
              read and write in the 1960s, a time of widespread prejudice
              against the Traveller community.
