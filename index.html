                Nolan's legacy and empowers disabled students and staff at
                Trinity College Dublin to showcase their creativity. The event

              <h3>A Brief Overview of Christy Nolan</h3>
              <p>
                Christopher Nolan (6 September 1965 - 20 February 2009), often
                called “Christy,” was an Irish poet and novelist who overcame
                the challenges of severe cerebral palsy to craft an
                extraordinary body of work that resonated with readers around
                the world. Born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, he famously used
                a “unicorn stick” attached to his forehead to type,
                demonstrating both his remarkable determination and inventive
                spirit. He published his first collection of poetry and prose,
                Dam-Burst of Dreams, as a teenager, then gained international
                acclaim with his autobiographical novel Under the Eye of the
                Clock, which won the prestigious Whitbread Award (now the Costa
                Book Awards). Nolan's lyrical style and distinctive perspective
                also shone in his later novel, The Banyan Tree, helping cement
                his reputation as a vital voice in Irish literature. Despite his
                physical limitations, Nolan's unwavering commitment to
                self-expression continues to inspire readers and writers alike,
                underscoring the resilience and boundless creativity of the
                human spirit.

                  The Long Room Hub (TLRH) is a serene and contemplative
                  environment, ideal for focused study and research. The
                  building's design, with its extensive use of natural light and
                  wood finishes, creates a calming and warm atmosphere. The
                  open-plan layout, particularly in the Ideas Space, allows
                  sound to travel between floors, which can be noticeable during
                  busier times or events. The top-floor postgraduate study space
                  is typically very quiet, providing an excellent environment
                  for concentration. However, on warmer days when the windows
                  are open, the sounds of the city, especially from nearby
                  Grafton Street, can filter in, adding a touch of urban
                  ambiance to the otherwise tranquil setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Navigating the Long Room Hub is straightforward, with clear
                  signage throughout the building. The main entrance opens into
                  a spacious lobby area that connects to the central Ideas
                  Space. A lift provides access to all floors, including the
                  quiet postgraduate study area on the fourth floor. However,
                  it's important to note that access to the building and
                  movement between floors requires a key card. Visitors
                  attending conferences or exhibitions will typically be
                  directed to the relevant areas by signage or staff, ensuring a
                  smooth experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Note:</strong> The Long Room Hub building has no

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The "Perseverance Through Words" competition celebrates Christy
          Nolan's legacy and empowers disabled students and staff at Trinity
          College Dublin to showcase their creativity. The event includes a
          competition launch, a midpoint workshop, and a final celebration
          featuring winning submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christy Nolan (1965-2009) remains a shining example of Irish
          creativity and literature. At just fifteen, he published his first
          poetry collection, Dam-Burst of Dreams, followed by his memoir, Under
          the Eye of the Clock, and later the critically acclaimed novel The
          Banyan Tree. During his time at Trinity College Dublin, Christy's
          disability was welcomed and he found the support he needed to thrive.
          Now, in recognition of his archival works being displayed in the Long
          Room at Trinity and to celebrate 25 years of the disAbility Service,
          we invite disabled staff and students at Trinity to share their
          creative talents in a competition open to all art forms—literary,
          visual, film, and performance. The winning works will be showcased in
          the “Old Library, New Treasures” exhibition and honored at a special
          event celebrating Christy's life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Perseverance Through Words" competition launched on Wednesday,
          12th February 2025.

              I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the Christy

              significant challenge I faced was adapting my workspace to
              accommodate my physical limitations: I needed specialized tools

              I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the Christy
              Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of resilience and
              self-discovery. From there, I experimented with different
              mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital tools—until I found the
              combination that best conveyed the idea of emerging strength. One
              significant challenge I faced was adapting my workspace to
              accommodate my physical limitations: I needed specialized tools
              with better grip and ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in
              turn, led me to explore more tactile techniques and texture in my

              I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words

              unheard and knowing our experiences still carry weight. As someone

              my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I believe that even the

              powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave me the confidence to
              highlight this quiet strength in my piece—conveying how, despite
