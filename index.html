                The "Perseverance Through Words" competition celebrates Christy
                Nolan's legacy and empowers disabled students and staff at
                Trinity College Dublin to showcase their creativity. The event
                includes a competition launch, a midpoint workshop, and a final
                celebration featuring winning submissions.

              <h3>A Brief Overview of Christy Nolan</h3>
              <p>
                Christopher Nolan (6 September 1965 - 20 February 2009), often
                called “Christy,” was an Irish poet and novelist who overcame
                the challenges of severe cerebral palsy to craft an
                extraordinary body of work that resonated with readers around
                the world. Born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, he famously used
                a “unicorn stick” attached to his forehead to type,
                demonstrating both his remarkable determination and inventive
                spirit. He published his first collection of poetry and prose,
                Dam-Burst of Dreams, as a teenager, then gained international
                acclaim with his autobiographical novel Under the Eye of the
                Clock, which won the prestigious Whitbread Award (now the Costa
                Book Awards). Nolan's lyrical style and distinctive perspective
                also shone in his later novel, The Banyan Tree, helping cement
                his reputation as a vital voice in Irish literature. Despite his
                physical limitations, Nolan's unwavering commitment to
                self-expression continues to inspire readers and writers alike,
                underscoring the resilience and boundless creativity of the
                human spirit.

                  The Long Room Hub (TLRH) is a serene and contemplative
                  environment, ideal for focused study and research. The
                  building's design, with its extensive use of natural light and
                  wood finishes, creates a calming and warm atmosphere. The
                  open-plan layout, particularly in the Ideas Space, allows
                  sound to travel between floors, which can be noticeable during
                  busier times or events. The top-floor postgraduate study space
                  is typically very quiet, providing an excellent environment
                  for concentration. However, on warmer days when the windows
                  are open, the sounds of the city, especially from nearby
                  Grafton Street, can filter in, adding a touch of urban
                  ambiance to the otherwise tranquil setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Navigating the Long Room Hub is straightforward, with clear
                  signage throughout the building. The main entrance opens into
                  a spacious lobby area that connects to the central Ideas
                  Space. A lift provides access to all floors, including the
                  quiet postgraduate study area on the fourth floor. However,
                  it's important to note that access to the building and
                  movement between floors requires a key card. Visitors
                  attending conferences or exhibitions will typically be
                  directed to the relevant areas by signage or staff, ensuring a
                  smooth experience.

                  <strong>Note:</strong> The Long Room Hub building has no

              <strong>Quote Connection:</strong> “How did the Christy Nolan
              quote you chose influence the direction or meaning of your work,
              and why did you feel it resonated with your personal experiences?”
            </h3>
            <p>
              I was drawn to the quote, 'Though I speak in silence, my words
              echo with truth,' because it captures the tension between feeling
              unheard and knowing our experiences still carry weight. As someone
              who uses alternative communication methods, I've often felt that
              my voice isn't fully recognized. Yet, I believe that even the
              quiet or unconventional ways we express ourselves can resonate
              powerfully. Christy Nolan's words gave me the confidence to
              highlight this quiet strength in my piece—conveying how, despite
              the seeming 'silence,' our truths can create ripples of
              understanding and empathy in others.

              <strong>Creative Process & Challenges:</strong> “What was your
              process for developing this piece, and did you encounter any
              particular challenges—whether artistic, technical, or related to
              accessibility—that shaped the final result?”
            </h3>
            <p>
              I began by sketching out a rough concept inspired by the Christy
              Nolan quote I'd chosen, focusing on themes of resilience and
              self-discovery. From there, I experimented with different
              mediums—charcoal, watercolor, and digital tools—until I found the
              combination that best conveyed the idea of emerging strength. One
              significant challenge I faced was adapting my workspace to
              accommodate my physical limitations: I needed specialized tools
              with better grip and ergonomic design to reduce strain. This, in
              turn, led me to explore more tactile techniques and texture in my
              piece. Although it was time-consuming to test and refine these
              methods, the experience ultimately helped me create a more
              layered, visually engaging artwork that truly represents my
              journey."

            <h3 class="fw-bold text-accessible-pink">
              <strong>Theme & Impact:</strong> “In exploring perseverance,
              identity, and creative expression, what core message or insight do
              you hope viewers, readers, or listeners will take away from your
              piece?”
            </h3>
            <p>
              I hope that my piece reminds people that perseverance is not just
              about pushing through difficult circumstances—it's also about
              embracing your own story and identity in the process. By weaving
              together visuals and narration that reflect personal growth, I
              wanted to show how creative expression can transform our struggles
              into something powerful and unifying. Ultimately, my aim is for
              anyone experiencing the work to feel seen and encouraged to use
              their own voice, recognizing that every unique perspective adds
              depth and beauty to our shared human experience.

              To me, art is a voice beyond words. It is a way to express
              emotions, experiences, and perspectives that cannot always be
              easily shared. Art connects us, even when we face barriers.

              In your opinion, what role does art play in building an inclusive
              future?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Writing allows us to share personal stories that might otherwise
              go unheard. By giving voice to our struggles and perspectives,
              written or visual art becomes a bridge to understanding. It's a
              therapeutic and healing process that opens doors for empathy,
              helping others connect with different experiences. In this way,
              art plays a crucial role in building a more inclusive and
              compassionate future.

              Joanne Touhey - In the Silence, We Hear
            </h3>
            <p>
              My piece, "In the Silence, We Hear," is a visual and poetic
              reflection on hearing loss. It features a poem paired with the
              word "inclusion" in sign language. The piece expresses the quiet
              strength of those, including myself, who navigate a world without
              full hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> An illustration titled "In the
              Silence, We Hear" featuring hand signs forming letters of the
              alphabet in Irish Sign Language (ISL), with hands of diverse skin
              tones. Below the illustration, a poem explores themes of living in
              silence, navigating a quiet world, and embracing differences. It
              emphasizes that silence is not emptiness but full of unspoken
              meaning, calling for understanding and breaking through barriers
              together. The design combines accessibility awareness with
              inclusivity and empowerment.

              Art means a lot to me. It's helped me in many ways. It's

              This is for my mum. “Worrying is worshiping the problem” is

              This is a piece representing a form of OCD that I have lived with

              my mind, paired with compulsions. And then I saw this quote of

              "Count to five," "Don't step on the crack," and "Rewrite it." At
              the bottom, subtle embossed text reads, "What if it all works

              Art, to me, is a bridge between my inner world and the external
              reality—a language that mirrors the way my thoughts naturally
              form. It offers a structure that feels more aligned with how I
              process and understand the world, allowing me to translate
              emotions, ideas, and experiences into something tangible. Through
              art, I can express complexities that often feel impossible to
              convey with words, giving shape to what resides within and
              creating a space where others can glimpse and connect with my
              internal landscape.

              <strong>Trains</strong> was written after my first day of college,

              stood in stillness, observing, others buzzed with anticipation,
              and the poem captures this contrast—a quiet contemplation of
              transition and movement and diverse perceptions.

              of pain, memory, and the struggle for clarity. At the bottom
              right, there is a circular abstract illustration in shades of
              pink, purple, and teal, resembling a microscopic or cosmic view.
              The artwork complements the reflective and introspective tone of
              the poem.

              Jessica K. Doyle - Fizzy Feet
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Fizzy Feet</strong> explores the beauty of slowing down
              and taking scenic routes literally and metaphorically. Written in
              a moment of magic and music and connection, though not initially
              about cats, on reflection it reminded me of moments spent walking
              with my two cats, where their curiosity anchors me to the present.
              Their playful exploration reminds me of childhood nostalgia— muddy
              boots stuck in the muck, little paws and how nature teaches us to
              slow down and immerse ourselves, even in moments of discomfort.
              The poem is also about finding growth and reflection in those
              too-light or too-tight or uncomfortable spaces and the wonder and
              growth one can find in the places we often try to avoid.
            </p>

              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> A poem titled Fizzy Feet by
              Jessica K. Doyle is written in black text on a soft gradient
              background of green and yellow hues. The poem describes themes of
              reflection, nostalgia, and finding peace. In the bottom-right
              corner, there is a simple black outline drawing of a cat stepping
              into a puddle, its tail raised. The illustration adds a whimsical
              touch to the contemplative tone of the poem.

              Audrey Steinier ~ Description of Artwork
            </h3>
            <p>
              This artwork is about the frustration and pain that comes with
              having a disability or illness that is not understood by the
              medical community. I have been prescribed medication for my
              chronic pain where the side effects of that medication were more
              pain of the same variety. Doctors are unsure of the origin of your
              pain or how you experience the pain, and so seem to prescribe
              medication based on your explanation of the pain (being
              neurodivergent does not help with this). In this artwork I have
              used my own medication tablets, their side effects, and the 2025
              national gallery of Ireland's calendar.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Art is one of the only ways for marginalised people to express
              themselves in a capitalist society. Through art, marginalised
              people can make themselves and their opinions visible to the
              dominant culture. Hopefully pushing for change not just in the art
              space but in greater society. Through art an individual can also
              process their anger and sadness that occurs in our current system
              of governance.

              <strong>ALT Description:</strong> An artwork featuring a National
              Gallery of Ireland calendar with stitched pill blister packs
              pinned across multiple dates, emphasising a sense of routine,
              medicalisation, or health-related themes. The calendar is layered
              with textured backgrounds and imagery, including birds and
              abstract patterns, adding a symbolic or emotional depth to the
              piece. Red threads connect the blister packs, creating a web-like
              visual narrative. This piece reflects themes of time, medication,
              and the impact of health on daily life, presented as part of an
              inclusive art event celebrating diverse perspectives.
